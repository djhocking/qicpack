Title: Model selection for generalized estimating equations using QIC
Version: 0.9
Date: 2012-12-10
Author: Daniel J. Hocking
Maintainer: Daniel J. Hocking <dhocking@unh.edu>
Description: This package contains the function 'qic', which calculates Pan's
    (2001) quasi likelihood information criteria (QIC) for models generated
    from the gee pack R package. The package also contains a function 'qictab'
    that compares a list of geeglm models from geepack and calculates delta
    QIC, QIC model weights, and cumulative model weights.
